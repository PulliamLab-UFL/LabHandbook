## Topics

### Summer 2014

This year, summer lab meetings will focus on building foundational skills in infectious disease dynamics, through essential reading and  [exercises](http://pulliamlab-ufl.github.io/summer2014/) based on the papers we read. The exercises will also provide an opportunity to gain additional [GitHub](http://github.com/) skills and experience.
