## Expectations

All [lab members and affiliates](http://pulliamlab.org/people) are expected to attend lab meetings whenever possible and to lead 1-2 meetings per year. Long-distance lab members and those who are traveling should plan to attend via [Google Hangouts](https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/event/cdve2cmnj0c0rr3re5o2dq1s0i0). If you need access to the lab hangout, please email [Dr. Pulliam](http://pulliamlab.org/people/pulliam) with your Google username. It is the responsibility of any lab member who intends to participate in a lab meeting remotely to coordinate with the presenter to ensure that this will be possible.

## Schedule

Lab meetings are held on Fridays from 12:30-1:30pm at [EPI](http://epi.ufl.edu "EPI @ UF"). Fall 2014 lab meetings will be held in the second floor conference room.

### Summer 2014

This year, summer lab meetings will focus on building foundational skills in infectious disease dynamics, through essential reading and  [exercises](http://www.pulliamlab.org/summer2014/) based on the papers we read. The exercises will also provide an opportunity to gain additional [GitHub](http://github.com/) skills and experience.

As preparation, you will need to create a branch of [this repository](https://github.com/PulliamLab-UFL/summer2014) to work in. [This page](branch.html) provides instructions for how to get started. Note that you will only be able to create a branch if you are a member of the [pulliamlab-everyone-RW](https://github.com/orgs/PulliamLab-UFL/teams/pulliamlab-everyone-rw/) team within the [PulliamLab-UFL](https://github.com/PulliamLab-UFL) organization on GitHub, but anyone can fork the repository and work on the exercises.

### Fall 2012 - Spring 2014
