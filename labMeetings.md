## Topics

### Fall 2014

To be added.

### Summer 2014

This year, summer lab meetings will focus on building foundational skills in infectious disease dynamics, through essential reading and  [exercises](http://www.pulliamlab.org/summer2014/) based on the papers we read. The exercises will also provide an opportunity to gain additional [GitHub](http://github.com/) skills and experience.

As preparation, you will need to create a branch of [this repository](https://github.com/PulliamLab-UFL/summer2014) to work in. [This page](branch.html) provides instructions for how to get started. Note that you will only be able to create a branch if you are a member of the [pulliamlab-everyone-RW](https://github.com/orgs/PulliamLab-UFL/teams/pulliamlab-everyone-rw/) team within the [PulliamLab-UFL](https://github.com/PulliamLab-UFL) organization on GitHub, but anyone can fork the repository and work on the exercises.

### Fall 2012 - Spring 2014
