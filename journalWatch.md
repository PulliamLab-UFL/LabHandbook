## Overview

We use Journal Watch as a way to collectively keep tabs on the literature. The basic idea is that each person in the lab is responsible for regularly scanning the contents of particular journals when they are published, noting articles of potential interest to lab members, and sharing and tagging them. Every week or so, you should also scan the Mendeley group to see what articles people have uploaded that they thought might be of interest to you (set the group to be filtered by 'my tags' then click on your name to get just those articles others have tagged for you). If you're not familiar with Mendeley, there are some nice introductory video tutorials at [mendeley.com](http://www.mendeley.com/videos-tutorials/).

The [Journal Watch 'Cheat Sheet'](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I2bxZQILvxhfxSOzIwZoGBvk_dU9MYIONXUBfmfLCtQ/edit) summarizes everyone's interests concisely so that you will have a better idea of what types of articles to tag for each person. The journals assigned to each person are listed next to their name.

## New lab members

- Please add yourself to the list, indicating your primary areas of interest.
- Let Juliet know if you have any trouble accessing the document, or if you have not yet received a message inviting you to join the Journal Watch group on Mendeley.
- Once you have been assigned some journals, you should add articles you expect to be of interest to other group members to the Mendeley group. Please tag papers with people's names (as given in the cheat sheet) so they can easily identify which papers might be of interest to them.
- If you have any questions about Journal Watch, you can get advice from any lab member who has been here longer than you!

## Tips to improve workflow
1. You can subscribe to the table of contents for your journals, so you are automatically emailed a list of new articles each time the journal comes out.
2. If you use [Feedly](http://feedly.com) or a similar program, you can subscribe to the journal's RSS feed (as an alternative to 1).
3. Mendeley has a feature that works with some browsers that allows you to add articles to Mendeley using an 'add to Mendeley' button, which you may want to install.
