**(1) CLONE the repository to your desktop**

This can be done from the repository's webpage (URL above):
- Click "Clone in Desktop" on the lower right-hand side of the page and follow the instructions

This can be done from within the GitHub GUI:
- Go to the main list of repositories
- On the left-hand side, you should see a place that says PulliamLab-UFL; click on this to see a list of lab repositories you have access to
- Scroll to PulliamLab-UFL/summer2014
- Click 'clone to computer'
- Select a location for the repository within your file system
- Click 'clone'

**(2) create a BRANCH with your name as the name of the branch**

This can be done from within the GitHub GUI:
- Double click on the repository you've just added
- Click on 'branches' in the sidebar
- Click on the + to create a new branch
- Enter your name as the branch name
- Click 'publish' next to your new branch (this adds the branch to the repository on github, which will allow the rest of us to see your synced commits)

**(3) switch to your new branch to create your code, write notes to yourself, etc**

This can be done from within the GitHub GUI:
- If you don't see a checkmark next to your new branch, click on the down arrow to bring up menu options, then click on 'switch to this branch'
- All of the work you do (on this) from here on out should be on this branch

**(4) edit, commit, and sync as you normally would**

**(5) if you have questions/comments as you go, use the GitHub issues tracker via the online interface to communicate with other lab members**
