## Logistics

You should sign up for a weekly meeting time if (a) Juliet is your primary or co-supervisor, or (b) you are registered for an independent study or other research credit with her. Each semester, you will have an opportunity to sign up for weekly meetings via a Doodle poll that indicates the time slots available. If you can’t make any of the times that are still available when you sign up, you should email Juliet directly, and she will work with you to figure something out.

## Philosophy

*A note from Juliet:*

One-on-one weekly meetings are your best opportunity to get individual feedback from me.  We will necessarily need to meet for an hour each week, but I do want to touch base with each of you on at least a weekly basis during the term, and I want to make sure the time is reserved in both of our schedules in case it is needed. If you don’t think we need to meet in a given week, just _let me know at least 24 hours in advance_ and send me

- an email update on your progress, and
- a reminder about anything you need from me before our next meeting.

There may be times when I have to cancel some or all of my weekly meetings due to travel or unavoidable conflicts; this is rare, and I will try to let you know at least a week ahead of time. There may also be times when we need to meet more than once a week. This is fine, and we can work it out on an as-needed basis.
